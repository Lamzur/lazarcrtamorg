        <b>LazarCrtam</b> project was started in early 2022. with the main goal being to capture all the states and mindsets
        that I was experiencing and have something to look back on and compare my current situation with the past ones.
        It was something that began with a lot of sadness and comedowns from various substances, but eventually
        transformed into something beautiful and inspiring. It's insane to think how the themes drastically improved and
        looking back I came to the realization that for me, art and the process of creating these pieces serves like a
        therapy session, and helps me cope with the reality of my current situation (assuming it's not that great).
